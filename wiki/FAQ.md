# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### Q: What is a Ballistic Coefficient?
A: The Ballistic Coefficient (BC) is a measure of a bullet's ability to overcome air resistance in flight. A higher BC indicates better aerodynamic performance.

### Q: How accurate are the predictions?
A: The tool's predictions are based on mathematical models and machine learning algorithms trained on real ballistic data. While highly accurate for most common scenarios, always verify critical calculations.

### Q: Can I use this for custom ammunition?
A: Yes, you can input custom ammunition parameters. The tool will calculate predictions based on these inputs.

## Technical Questions

### Q: Why does the 3D visualization take time to load?
A: The 3D visualization requires complex calculations and rendering. Performance depends on your system specifications.

### Q: How often is the firearm database updated?
A: The database is regularly updated with new firearms and ammunition data. Check the GitHub repository for the latest updates.

### Q: Can I export the results?
A: Currently, you can capture screenshots of the analysis. Export functionality is planned for future updates.

## Troubleshooting
